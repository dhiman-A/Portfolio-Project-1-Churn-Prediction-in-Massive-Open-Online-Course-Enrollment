Project: Churn Prediction in Massive Open Online Course Enrollment

Summary: Using multivariable logistic regression, I created 4 models to determine the likelihood for churn by MOOC students, a group known for their well-documented lack of commitment to educational products.

Techology used:

Python


Datasets: Kaggle

Key insights shared:

Despite a 90% accuracy, the model precision was considerably lower (high 60%)
Best predictors of likelihood to churn included: Percentage of course complete, percentage of course audited and whether or not the individual held a bachelorâ€™s degree

Reduction of features created a more precise model, with accuracy and precision metrics hovering around 95%


Why this project works:

Tackles a pervasive business problem: Churn
Demonstrates proficiency in building ML models
Shows ability to interpret and present model results
